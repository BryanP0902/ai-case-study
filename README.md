# Morse Corp Case Study

## Overview and Origin
Morse Corp is a National Defense contractor company that was founded in 2014 by Andreas Kellas and Bobby Cohanim. Currently funded primarily by MassChallenge(2) and 100% employee owned. Their main focus  is algorithm development, software development, and system integration services for machine learning, artificial intelligence, mission planning, situational awareness, computer vision, and manned and unmanned aerial vehicles.

## Business Activities
The company has recieved multiple government contracts within Defense, Space Manufacturing, and other elements within the US national security ecosystem. Working with the Joint Artificial Intelligence center to develop AI capabilities they have receied contracts with the U.S. Army that includes modernizing their data and software engineering capabilities, advanced technology development, and upgrading their airdrop system.

## Landscape
A lot of the competitors in the field include Space Tango, Raytheon Co., Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., and Lockheed Martin Corp. Artificial Intelligence has been implemented in many forms within the military throughout history including from DARPA funding for the first academic research hubs of AI, at MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon in the 1960s, Cold War-era SAGE air defense system, which could ingest vast amounts of data from multiple radars, process it in real time, and produce targeting information for intercepting aircraft and missiles, to the Dynamic Analysis and Re-planning Tool, DART, that DoD started using in the early 1990s, saving millions of dollars and logistical headaches in moving forces to the Middle East for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.(4)

"At the same time, we benefit from a national position of strength, and our own uses grow stronger every day. And we will be keeping up the momentum, ensuring we make the best possible use of AI technology responsibly and at speed."

-Kathleen H. Hicks(Deputy Secretary of Defense)

## Results
Due to the secretive nature of national defense it is difficult to identify specifics as to what the company has accoplished, however there have been a steady stream of $40 million plus contracts for a company less than 200 employees, there must be a noticable impact to continue receiving offers. Their impact also extends to pledging money to the Homes for our Troops charity.

## Recommendations
As far as technology is concerned there isn't much more than what is currently utilized. Taking on employees/advisors with a long military background could greatly provide a lot of insight. As with any new pioneering form of technology it is always best to understand where we have been to gain a better understanding of where we are going.
